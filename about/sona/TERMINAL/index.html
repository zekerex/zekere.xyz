    <p>Terminal has a lot of interest and passion for the strange, vast world they inhabit. They are a large, bio-mechanical mass with an 
        unknown origin, it doesn't seem like it was created by anyone and simply just exists, despite looking man-made. 
    </p>

    <p>They are constantly logging information pertaining to the world and expresses great love for it.</p>
