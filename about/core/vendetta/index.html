    <p>
        Vendetta often confuses their imagination for reality. How they see the world is very different compared to the
        average person.
        They seem to be in a constant state of dreaming- even when their eyes are clearly open. They see higher planes of
        existence that many others cannot see- beings and monsters that communicate in glyphs, towers made out of eyes,
        and so on...
