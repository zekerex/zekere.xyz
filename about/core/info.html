        <div class="chunk">
        <h2>Who are these characters?</h2>
        <p>The characters listed
            on this page are less so "characters," and moreso packages of ideas and concepts that can be reconfigured
            depending on the scenario; they
            are all nebelous, amorphous in nature. I call them "muses."</p>
    
        <p>Muses all belong to a single entity called, "The Core," a multi-dimensional, ever-transforming super-structure
            that spans across time and space.
            It's more than just an entity- it can be a feeling or a place as well.
    
        <p>The rainbow transforming background on this page is sort of a visual representation of what it would be like to see it in the
            third dimension. Weird, constantly shifting bands of light, mostly. That's what at least the surface of The Core looks
            like; there is more on the inside.</p>    
        </div>

        <div class="chunk">
            <h2>What are these character's pronouns?</h2>
            <p>They don't abide by human terms because they are not human. Gendered terms do not exist in their language. I use 
                "they" or "it" (sometimes), when referring to them.

        <div class="chunk">
            <h2>Are These Your Alternate Personalities?</h2>
            <p>No. Why are you so nosy, anyways?</p>
