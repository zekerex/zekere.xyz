    <p>Hello! Pardon the dust, this is a work in progress page!</p>

    <p>I have a pretty sentimental attachment to computers and I am very passionate about 
        them, I shall catalogue some of my computerisms here. 
    </p>

    <p>Yes, I name my computers, it's just a cute little thing I do to distinguish them.</p>

        <p><b>Vivo</b> is an ASUS Vivobook that I got around 2022, hence the name. It's a pretty 
        decent Laptop all things considered, it is slightly more powerful 
        than the average laptop, but it cannot do intensive tasks like 3D rendering.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="box">
        <h1>Main PC (Spectrum)!</h1>
        <p>Spectrum is featured on the <a href="/about/">about</a> page.</p>

        <p>This is a pre-built ASUS PC that I got in 2020. It still holds up decently well despite the
            fast-moving tech of today. I am planning on replacing its very RAM soon, because we're 
            getting to the point where 32 GBs of RAM is the new standard, especially if you do 
            anything intensive like <u>3D</u>.
        </p>

        <p>I gave it the name <i>Spectrum</i> because of the obnoxious RGB lights it has built into 
            its case. However, I am also planning on swapping out the case entirely later down the 
            line, so it might not be as bright and shiny as they used to be! If I ever get 
            new fans, they will be RGB ones to kind of still fit the theme.
        </p>

        <p>I will not be getting any pre-built PCs after Spectrum, unless they are vintage, 
            of course. From here on I will be doing a lot of the heavy-lifting instead.
