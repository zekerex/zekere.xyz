    <p>Jigsaw is also a DJ, similar to Skrill. The two enjoy brash sounds and are often seen collaborating. Occasionally, RK-0 
        also enjoys to chip in their sessions.</p>
    <p>They're sort of both simultaneously social and introverted, which sort of frustrates them.</p> 

    <p>Jigsaw's appearance changes frequently- mostly during a shift in state of mind. These different appearances are called, 
        "modules." It's a rare adaptation. The way they produce their music also changes depending on module.</p>
        
    <p>At rest, Jigsaw is typically seen as MODULE_1, but when in a calm, dreamy state of mind, they are in MODULE_2. 
        MODULE_3 appears in times of extreme distress.
