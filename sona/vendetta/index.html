    <p>
        Vendetta often confuses his imagination for reality. How he sees the world is very different compared to the
        average person.
        He seems to be in a constant state of dreaming- even when his eyes are clearly open. He sees higher planes of
        existence that many others cannot see- beings and monsters that communicate in glyphs, towers made out of eyes,
        and so on...
