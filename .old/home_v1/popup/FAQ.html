    <h2>"Can I use the assets you created for your site for my own?"</h2>
    <p>Unless they are free to use graphics located at <a href="/graphix.html">the graphics page</a>, please don't use assets that I have created for my site for your own.
    <ul><li>
        You are free to make assets to a similar style to mine, I am not an "art style cop."
    </li></ul></p>

    <div class="q">
    <h2>"Your stuff is cool! will you ever do commissions?"</h2>
    <p>Thank you! However, art is a deep passion of mine and it comes from my heart- doing it for another person is a whole other story. I have done 
        commissions before but they are not fufilling for me. I would much rather create for myself. If I ever take on something that's 
        not my own, it's most likely because it comes from a place of passion; I am very particular.</p>

    <div class="q">
    <h2>"Do you have any social media?"</h2>
    <p>Not at this moment, no. I don't enjoy using social media. It used to be fun, but then it started to become rather stressful.
        I also don't want to gain that big of a following. This could change in the future, but this site will always be my "main."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="q">
        <h2>"How to (insert thing)?"</h2>
        <p>I will make a page dedicated on this specific subject eventually, because I think it is important. The only way to 
            learn how to do something is to try, even if it comes out badly at first- <i>do not hesitate!</i></p>
        <p>I have resources listed in <a href="/linkland/index.html">linkland</a>, if that may interest you.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if you want to learn something more technical like coding, "inspect element," a bunch of random 
            sites, poke around- try to get a feel for how certain things operate. You will eventually pick up on patterns. 
            You can apply this, "rule of observation," to many things, even art.
