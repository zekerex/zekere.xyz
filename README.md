ENG:
This is my personal website created to showcase my work and be a general base of operations- it is written in basic HTML and CSS (no framework)- with a light hint of Javascript.
There are many incomplete parts of the site that will be added eventually, I am quite busy and am not always able to work on the site.

If you think there are any parts of the site that can be improved, you are always free to give me feedback!

As of Oct 10, 2025: Right now this website has gotten quite big and unruly. my aim was to have each part of the site have a distinct identity, as I don't really enjoy uniformity in my designs
(that is something I have always struggled with), so there are lots and lots of custom assets needed for that task.

The other issue is that I have ran out of many ideas on what the other pages could possibly look like. That combined with other struggles related to publishing my work online, for instance,
has left me feel discouraged from proceeding development.

JPN:
*Coming soon.*
