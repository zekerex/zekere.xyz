ENG:
This is my personal website created to showcase my work and be a general base of operations- it is written in basic HTML and CSS (no framework)- with a light hint of Javascript.
There are many incomplete parts of the site that will be added eventually, I am quite busy and am not always able to work on the site.

If you think there are any parts of the site that can be improved, you are always free to give me feedback!

JPN:
*Coming soon.*
