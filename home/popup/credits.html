    <p>Most if not all of the assets and code on my website was created by me, <span class="gern">Radiation</span>,
        however, there are a few things that I
        have not made myself that I have made an effort to compile and credit <b>here</b>.</p>

    <h2>Fonts I use on this site:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="">Pixelcaps!</a> by <a href="https://markuskoellmann.com/">Markus Koellmann</a>
        <li>"Px437_IBM_BIOS-2x", "Px437_DOS-V_TWIN16" and "Px437_IBM_DOS_ISO9" from <a
                href="https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/">The
                Ultimate Oldschool PC Font Pack</a>.
    </ul>

    <h2>Graphics:</h2>
    <i>
        <p>I am using every graphic listed here under FAIR USE. Additionally, this is a personal site, and I am not
            making a profit off of anything I host here.</p>
    </i>

    <h3>Regarding Graphics from the "Old Web"</h3>
    <p>Graphics from the earlier ages of the internet (I am mainly referring to the Web 1.0 era of the internet) are not
        exactly the easiest things to source. If there <i>is</i> a clear source to any of them, I will
        list them here (for now there is nothing to list). Most of the graphics I use on this page that are from this
        period were found on <a href="https://gifcities.org/">Gifcities</a>.</p>

    <h2>Code:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Jdan's <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">98.css</a></li>
    </ul>
