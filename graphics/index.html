            <p>Welcome! There isn't much to showcase here yet, but it'll have more over time.</p>

            <p>All of the graphics here are <u>free to use</u>. I appreciate it if you were to link back to this page
            if you were to use any of these. A lot of the time though web graphics do eventually kind of "lose," their source, 
        so I'm kind of expecting that to happen here, too.</p>

            <p>Have fun and go crazy!</p>
