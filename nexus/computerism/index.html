    <p>Hello! Pardon the dust, this is a work in progress page! <br>
    I have a pretty sentimental attachment to computers and I am very passionate about 
        them, I shall catalogue some of my computerisms here. 
    </p>

    <p>Yes, I name my computers, it's just a cute little thing I do to distinguish them.</p>

            <h2>Main PC (Spectrum)!</h2>
            <p>Spectrum is featured on the <a href="/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about</a> page.</p>

            <p>This is a pre-built ASUS PC that I got in 2020. It still holds up decently well despite the
                fast-moving tech of today. I am planning on replacing its very RAM soon, because we're 
                getting to the point where 32 GBs of RAM is the new standard, especially if you do 
                anything intensive like <u>3D</u>.
            </p>

            <p>I gave it the name <i>Spectrum</i> because of the obnoxious RGB lights it has built into 
                its case. However, I am also planning on swapping out the case entirely later down the 
                line, so it might not be as bright and shiny as they used to be! If I ever get 
                new fans, they will be RGB ones to kind of still fit the theme.
            </p>

            <p>I will not be getting any pre-built PCs after Spectrum, unless they are vintage, 
                of course. From here on I will be doing a lot of the heavy-lifting instead.

            <h2>My Laptop (Vivo)!</h2>
            <div class="neofetchtext">

            <p><b>Vivo</b> is an ASUS Vivobook that I got around 2022, hence the name. It's a pretty 
            decent Laptop all things considered, it is slightly more powerful 
            than the average laptop, but it cannot do intensive tasks like 3D rendering.</p>

            <p>Vivo is currently running the latest 64 bit version of Arch Linux and KDE as its 
               primary desktop enviroment. 
            </p>

            <p>Vivo is very good for traveling and general on-the-go work, and I use it as a backup 
                computer whenever Spectrum is, "out of order."
